    <h3>Description</h3>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 tablespoon salted butter</li>
        <li>2+ slices 3/4 inch thick sourdough bread</li>
        <li>1 serving cooking spray</li>
        <li>1 pack of 16 ounce elbow macaroni</li>
        <li>4 cups freshly grated sharp Cheddar cheese</li>
        <li>2 cups freshly grated smoked Gouda cheese</li>
        <li>1/2 cup salted butter</li>
        <li>1 1/2 cup whole milk, divided</li>
        <li>2 1/2 tablespoon cornstarch</li>
        <li>2 1/2 cup half-and-half</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon pink Himalayan salt</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon ground white pepper</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon paprika</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Directions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Melt 1 tablespoon butter on a griddle over medium-high heat. Add bread and cook until toasted, 1 to 2 minutes per side. Set aside to cool.</li>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Coat a 9x13-inch baking pan with cooking spray.</li>
        <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook elbow macaroni in the boiling water, stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, about 8 minutes. Drain macaroni and transfer to a large bowl.</li>
        <li>Place cooled toast in a resealable bag and slowly crush with the bottom of a saucepan or a rolling pin. Set bread crumbs aside.</li>
        <li>Mix Cheddar and Gouda cheeses together and divide into 4 equal piles.</li>
        <li>Melt 1/2 cup butter in a saucepan over medium heat.</li>
        <li>While butter is melting, whisk 1 cup milk and cornstarch together in a bowl until cornstarch has dissolved. Add milk-cornstarch mixture to the melted butter. Gradually mix in remaining 1/2 cup milk and half-and-half. Cook, whisking continuously, until mixture thickens to the consistency of a milkshake, 3 to 5 minutes. Add 2 piles of cheese, one at a time, whisking after each addition until cheese has completely melted.</li>
        <li>Pour cheese sauce over cooked macaroni and mix to coat. Transfer 1/2 of the mac and cheese mixture to the reserved baking pan and spread evenly. Sprinkle 1 pile of cheese over top. Evenly distribute the rest of the mac and cheese mixture into the pan, sprinkle with remaining cheese, and top with reserved breadcrumbs.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until golden and bubbly, 15 to 20 minutes.</li>
    </ol>
