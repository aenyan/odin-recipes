    <h3>Meatloaf Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 carrot, coarsely chopped</li>
        <li>1 rib celery, coarsely chopped</li>
        <li>1/2 onion, coarsely chopped</li>
        <li>1/2 red bell pepper, coarsely chopped</li>
        <li>4 white mushrooms, coarsely chopped</li>
        <li>3 cloves garlic, coarsely chopped</li>
        <li>2 1/2 pounds ground chuck</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce</li>
        <li>1 egg, beaten</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon dried Italian herbs</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons salt</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon cayenne pepper</li>
        <li>1 cup plain bread crumbs</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon olive oil</li>       
    </ul>
    <h3>Glaze Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 tablespoons brown sugar</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons ketchup</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons Dijon mustard</li>
        <li>hot pepper sauce to taste</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Directions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F.</li>
        <li>Place the carrot, celery, onion, red bell pepper, mushrooms, and garlic in a food processor, and pulse until very finely chopped, almost to a puree. Place the minced vegetables into a large mixing bowl, and mix in ground chuck, Worcestershire sauce, and egg. Add Italian herbs, salt, black pepper, and cayenne pepper. Mix gently with a wooden spoon to incorporate vegetables and egg into the meat. Pour in bread crumbs. With your hand, gently mix in the crumbs with your fingertips just until combined, about 1 minute.</li>
        <li>Form the meatloaf into a ball. Pour olive oil into a baking dish and place the ball of meat into the dish. Shape the ball into a loaf, about 4 inches high by 6 inches across.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven just until the meatloaf is hot, about 15 minutes.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, in a small bowl, mix together brown sugar, ketchup, Dijon mustard, and hot sauce. Stir until the brown sugar has dissolved.</li>
        <li>Remove the meatloaf from the oven. With the back of a spoon, smooth the glaze onto the top of the meatloaf, then pull a little bit of glaze down the sides of the meatloaf with the back of the spoon.</li>
        <li>Return meatloaf to oven, and bake until the loaf is no longer pink inside and the glaze has baked onto the loaf, 30 to 40 more minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the thickest part of the loaf should read at least 160 degrees F (70 degrees C). Cooking time will depend on shape and thickness of the meatloaf.</li>
    </ol>
